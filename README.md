   Reproducing plots of paper:  ## Multiparticle Quantum Walks and Fisher Information in One-Dimensional Lattices https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.100406
As a part of my coursework at NISER, "Special topics in Quantum Mechanics", I presented and reporduced the results of paper 
"Multiparticle quantum walks and Fisher   information in one-dimensional lattices Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 100406 (2021))"
The paper is very interesting and marks one of my first encounter with Bloch oscillations and Fisher Information.
